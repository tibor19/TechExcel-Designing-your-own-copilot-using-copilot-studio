	> You can choose to avoid the conversational creation experience by selecting **Skip to configure** You can set the copilot’s primary language in the **Edit language** menu. For the lab, be sure to remain in English (en-US). It is a best practice to always configure your copilot in the context of your own solution and publisher, so that the copilot is created with the desired publisher prefix, and so that you can easily export it and deploy it to other environments.
